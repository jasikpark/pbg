Hi, I'm Noah **_Grey_** Jasik

I'm from Cypress, Texas, and I've grown up with a love for baking!!

I won the Cupcake Battle of [CFISD](https://cfisd.net) in first place in [2018](https://www.cfisd.net/en/news-media/district/students-place-second-annual-cfisd-cupcake-battle) with my chocolate cupcake with peppermint buttercream frosting and ganache, and in second place in [2019](https://culinaryinstitute.edu/culinary-arts-students-take-top-honors-in-third-cfisd-cupcake-battle/) with my [carrot cake cupcakes with buttercream frosting]({{< ref "/menu/desserts/cupcakes/carrot" >}}).
